/**
 * Class to support writing to message/payload tables with high concurrency.
 *
 * It uses a non-blocking algorithm to batch writes from concurrent threads. The algorithm is the same as
 * the one used in ConcurrentStreamWriter.
 *
 * The algorithm is like this:
 *
 * When a thread that received a request, performs the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1. Constructs a PendingWrite locally and enqueue it to a ConcurrentLinkedQueue.
 * 2. Use CAS to set an AtomicBoolean flag to true.
 * 3. If successfully set the flag to true, this thread becomes the writer and proceed to run step 4-7.
 * 4. Provides an Iterator of PendingWrite, which consumes from the ConcurrentLinkedQueue mentioned in step 1.
 * 5. The message table store method will consume the Iterator until it is empty
 * 6. Set the state of each PendingWrite that are written to COMPLETED (succeed/failure).
 * 7. Set the AtomicBoolean flag back to false.
 * 8. If the PendingWrite enqueued by this thread is NOT COMPLETED, go back to step 2.
 * </pre>
 *
 * The spin lock between step 2 to step 8 is necessary as it guarantees events enqueued by all threads would eventually
 * get written and flushed.
